# 02 Linked List

1. Write a program to create a singly linked list and perform insertions and deletions of
   all cases. Write functions to sort and finally delete the entire list at once.
2. Write a program to create a circular singly linked list. Perform insertion and deletion at
   the beginning and end of the list.
3. Write a program to create a doubly linked list and perform insertions and deletions in
   all cases.
4. Write a program to create a circular doubly linked list and perform insertions and
   deletions at the beginning and end of the list.
5. Write a program to store a polynomial using linked list. Also, perform addition and
   subtraction on two polynomials.
6. Write a program that removes all nodes that have duplicate information.
7. Write a program to print the total number of occurrences of a given item in the linked
   list.
8. Write a program to multiply every element of the linked list with 10.
9. Write a program to print the number of non-zero elements in the list.
10. Write a program that prints whether the given linked list is sorted (in ascending order)
    or not.
11. Write a program that copies a circular linked list.
12. Write a program to merge two linked lists.
13. Write a program to sort the values stored in a doubly circular linked list.
14. Write a program to merge two sorted linked lists. The resultant list must also be sorted
15. Write a program to create a linked list from an already given list. The new linked list
    must contain every alternate element of the existing linked list.
16. Write a program to delete the first element of a doubly linked list. Add this node as the
    last node of the list.
17. Write a program to
    (a) Delete the first occurrence of a given character in a linked list
    (b) Delete the last occurrence of a given character
    (c) Delete all the occurrences of a given character
18. Write a program to reverse a linked list using recursion.
19. Write a program to input an n digit number. Now, break this number into its individual
    digits and then store every single digit in a separate node thereby forming a linked list.
    For example, if you enter 12345, then there will 5 nodes in the list containing nodes
    with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
20. Write a program that prints minimum and maximum values in a linked list that stores
    integer values.
21. Write a program to interchange the value of the first element with the last element,
    second element with second last element, so on and so forth of a doubly linked list.
22. Write a program to make the first element of singly linked list as the last element of the
    list.
23. Write a program that adds 10 to the values stored in the nodes of a doubly linked list.
24. Write a program to delete the kth node from a linked list.
25. Write a program to create a linked list which stores the details of employees in a department. Read and print the information stored in the list.
26. Write a program to move a middle node of a doubly link list to the top of the list.
27. Write a program to create a singly linked list and reverse the list by interchanging the links and not the data.
