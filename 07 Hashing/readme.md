# 07 Hashing
1. Write a program to insert the keys 50, 70, 76, 93 using a simple hash
function as `key mod 5` using **Linear Probing**.
2. Let us consider table `Size = 7`, hash function as `Hash(x) = x % 7`, Insert
= 22, 30, and 50 using **mid-square method** and resolve the collision
using *quadratic probing* where `c1=0` and `c2=3`.
3. Insert the keys 27, 43, 692, 72 into the Hash Table of `size 7` using
folding method and avoid the Collison using first hash-function is `h1(k) = k mod 7` and second hash-function is `h2(k) = 1 + (k mod 5)`.
Write a program using **Double Hashing**.
4. Write a program to insert 28, 5, 19, 15, 33, 12, 17, 77, 20 into hash table
with `9 slots` using **division method** and resolve the collision by using
*Linear Method*.
5. Write a program to insert 73, 45, 37, 65, 77, 88, 100, 121 into a hash
table with `11 slots` using **multiplication method** and resolve the
collision using quadratic probing with `c1=0` and `c2=2`
